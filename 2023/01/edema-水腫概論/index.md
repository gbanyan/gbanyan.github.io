- ## Pathophysiology  
  - Increased capillary hydraulic pressure **增加血液中淨水壓**  
  - Hypoalbuminemia (ex: liver cirrhosis) **低血液白蛋白濃度**  
  - Increased capillary permeability **微血管通透性增加，可能原因是一些細胞激素的種類增加**  
  	- Cytokine (ex: TNF, IL-1, IL-10, Prostaglanding) secretion  
  	- Ex: 燙傷、發炎、感染、過敏  
  - Lymphatic obstruction lymphedema (ex: axillary dissection for breast cancer ) **淋巴循環系統阻塞**  
  - Myxedema (hypothyroidism) **黏液性水腫**  
  - ### Compensation mechanism  
  	- 為了代償血管內的水分流失，腎臟會傾向吸收更多水分 (to compensate the fluid loss in vessels, the kidney tend to water retention with Na+ reabsorption)  
  		- Angiotension II  
  		- Norephinephrine  
  		- Aldosterone  
  		- Antidiuretic hormone  
  	- may cause vicious cycle  

- ## Etiology  
  - Heart failure  
  - Liver cirrhosis  
  - Nephrotic syndrome and other forms of kidney disease  
  - Premenstrual edema and pregnancy  
  - Drug-induced edema  
  	- **Thiazolidinedione (TZD)類口服降血糖藥** (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone), PPAR, may increase Na+ reabsorption in the renal collecting duct (like Aldosterone)   
  	- **Calcium channel blockers (dihydropyridine, Norvasc), CCB**, dilatation of the precapillary sphincter  
  	- **NSAID**, inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis, exacerbate edema in patients with underlying heart failure or cirrhosis  
  	- **Fludrocortison**: unusual  
  	- **Estrogen**, promote Sodium reabsorption, primarily in patients with impaired estrogen metabolism due to hepatic disease  
  	- **Pramipexole**, a dopamine agonist used in the treatment of Parkinson disease and restless legs syndrome,  
  	- **Docetaxel**, used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer  
  - Refeeding edema (quite unusual)  

- ## Evaluation  
  - ### Types  
  	- Peripheral edema  
  	- Pulmonary edema  
  	- Ascites  
  	- Lymphedema  
  	- Periorbital and scrotal edema  
  	
  - ### Pitting edema definition  
  	- More common 較常見的 edema 類型  
  	- Presence of tissue depression after pressure is applied to the edematous area for at least five seconds **水腫處壓迫五秒後仍繼續塌陷**  
  	- Excess interstitial water in response to pressure  
  	- If note -> suspect hypothyroidism or lymphatic obstruction  
  	
  - ### Distinguish  
  	- Acute onset or chronic  
  	- BIlateral or unialteral  
  	
  - ### Acute unilateral Leg edema 急性單側腳水腫  
  	- Most dangerous → consider the DVT, the wells score combined with D-dimer to rule out  
  	- Not DVT, consider:  
  		- Muscle strain or twist injury  
  		- Paralyzed limb with leg swelling  
  		- Lymphangitis or lymph obstruction  
  		- Venous insufficiency  
  		- Popliteal (Baker's) cyst  
  		- Cellulitis  
  			- 最常見症狀：紅腫熱痛加發燒，不過有些血管有問題的也有可能表現類似症狀  
  			- Some patients with venous insufficiency develop a low-grade, nonbacterial cellulitis, which resembles infectious cellulitis,  
  		- May-turner syndrome:  
  			- younger females (20-30 year-old)  
  			- acute pain and swelling of the entire left lower extremity  
  			- with or without venous thrombosis.  
  	
  - ### Chronic unilateral or asymmetric edema 慢性單側水腫  
  	- Most common: lower extremity chronic venous disease  
  		- history of thrombophlebitis in affected leg  
  		- longstanding → pigmentary changes and skin ulceration  
  	- Less common:  
  		- Primary or secondary lymphedema  
  			- history of inguinal or pelvic lymph node dissection  
  			- radiation therapy  
  			- initially pitting, but became non-pitting for cutaneous fibrosis occurs  
  		- Complex regional pain syndrome (複雜性局部疼痛症候群)  
  			- 4-6 weeks after limb truma  
  			- pain, edema, and alteration in skin color and temperature  
  			- [複雜性局部疼痛症候群｜皮膚變得異常敏感？｜熱河診所](https://enjoyyoung.com/medical-info/複雜性局部疼痛症候群-與傷害不成正比的激烈/)  
  		- Pelvic neoplasm compromising venous return  
  			- Suspected when Compression Ultrasonography (CUS) showed a outflow obstruction  
  			- Ovarian cancer  
  			- Endometrial cancer  
  			- Bladder cancer  
  			- Lymphoma  
  			- Prostate cancer  
  	
  - ### Acute bilateral leg edema  急性雙側水腫  
  	- Uncommon  
  	- Most likely etiology:  
  		- Side effect of medications  
  		- Acute heart failure  
  			- Dyspnea, orthopnea, ,paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, tachypnea ,tachycardia, rales, or distended neck veins  
  		- Acute nephrotic syndrome  
  			- urine dipstick positive for protein  
  		- Bilateral DVT, often associated with malignancy  
  	
  - ### Chronic bilateral leg edema 慢性雙側水腫  
  	- Heart failure  
  	- Pulmonary hypertension  
  	- Renal disease  
  	- Liver disease  
  	- Pelvic neoplasm  
  	- Constrictive pericarditis  
  	- Idiopathic edema  
  	- Premenstrual edema  
  	- Malnutrition  
  	
  - ### Arm edema  
  	- trauma, infection, superficial thrombophlebitis, or inflammatory arthritis, apparent in history  
  	- Extremity venous thrombosis should be suspected when none of the etiologies noted  
  	- Acute bIlateral upper edema is rare, may be seen on superior vena cava syndrome  
  	
  - ### Pulmonary edema  
  	- Uncomplicated cirrhosis is not associated with pulmonary edema, in contrast to cardiac and renal disease  
  	- Pulmonary edema not occurred in isolated hypoalbuminemia 
  	
  - ### Lymphedema  
  	- Most common in developed countries: ALND  
  	- Most common in worldwide: filariasis  

- ## Treatment  
  - ### When must edema be treated?  
  	- **Pulmonary edema** 是最危險需立即處理的  
  	- 其他的如果沒有立即性危險，可以慢慢脫水，尤其是對 Cirrhosis 的病人來說，如果過度脫水導致的低血鉀、代謝性鹼中毒、還有快速的體液容積變化有可能會加重 hepatic encephalopathy
  	
  - ### Consequence of the diuretic use  
  	- Reduction in cardiac output on patients with heart failure  
  	- Diuretic-induced fluid removal leads to increased secretion of the three "hypovolemic" hormones (renin, norepinephrine, and antidiuretic hormone)  
  	- Despite the reduction in the effective arterial blood volume, most patients benefit from the appropriate use of diuretics.  
  		- Pulmonary congestion improved  
  		- Relief of symptoms of fatigue and bloating with noncardiac cause of edema  
  	- Decrease in effective arterial blood volume impair tissue perfusion condition:  
  		- **Severe heart failure** in very low baseline effective arterial blood volume  
  		- **Rapid fluid removal in cirrhosis**  
  	- Monitoring:  
  		- BUN and Crea  
  		- Any symptoms imply decline in tissue perfusion: fatigue, weakness ,postural dizziness, lethargy or confusion  
  	- Impaired renal function **SHOULD NOT** occurred after the appropriate use of diuretics  
  	
  - ### How rapidly should edema fluid be removed?  
  	- Generalized edema due to heart failure, the nephrotic syndrome, or primary sodium retention  
  		- the edema fluid can be mobilized rapidly since most capillary beds are involved  
  		- With anasarca (全身水腫), removal of 2 to 3 liters of edema fluid or more in 24 hours  
  	- **300 to 500 mL/day** : the maximum amount that can be mobilized by most patients with isolated ascites (腹水但沒有周邊水腫的)  
  	- Diuretics should be carefully used in **Venous insufficiency, lymphedema, and malignant ascites**  
  	
  - ### Diuretics Options  
  	- Generally begin with loop diuretics: *furosemide*  
  	- Monitoring BUN, crea, and electrolyte complication  
  	- Preferred regimen in different condition:  
  		- Cirrhosis: spironolactone (to prevent hypokalemia) and loop diuretics
  		- Heart failure: just monitor the signs of hypoperfusion  
  		- Nephrotic syndrome: higher dose of diuretics is needed because transport of the diuretic into the tubular lumen is impaired.
